# GBIF Occurrence Parser

This module is a library responsible for parsing occurrences from the XML publishing formats (ABCD and DWC) as provided by Digir, Tapir and Biocase endpoints. The object model and language used here closely mirrors the original view of this data from the pre-Hadoop days at GBIF. Because of that it is somewhat clumsy and awkward to use. The OccurrenceParser class is the entry point.
